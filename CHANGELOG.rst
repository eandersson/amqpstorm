Version 1.3.0
-------------

- Channels are no longer closed after RabbitMQ throws a recoverable exception.
- Added Error mapping based on the AMQP 0.9.1 specifications (when applicable).
    Introduced three new variables to the AMQPStorm Exceptions.
        - error_code: This provides HTTP style error codes based on the AMQP Specification.
        - error_type: This provides the full AMQP Error name; e.g. NO-ROUTE.
        - documentation: This provides the official AMQP Specification documentation string.

    These variables are available on all AMQPStorm exceptions, but if no error code was
    provided by RabbitMQ, they will be empty.

    Usage:
        except AMQPChannelError as why:
            if why.error_code == 312:
                self.channel.queue.declare(queue_name)
